Welcome to adva-cms
===================
 
adva-cms is a cutting edge open source application platform based on Ruby on
Rails and Rails Engines.

Different from others, adva-cms lives in vendor directory and keeps your main
app directory clean and dandy. So you can reclaim app directory and use it
only for your own application files.

Adva makes it extensible: you can only pick those engines/features you really
need for your application and omit the rest. All engines are designed to work
together seamlessly, so the whole platform feels much more consistent for
similar but separate Rails applications.
