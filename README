Wecolme to Adva
===============

Adva cms is a cutting edge open source application platform 
based on Ruby on Rails and Rails Engines.

Different from others, adva cms lives in vendor directory and keeps your
main app directory clean and dandy. So you can reclaim app directory and 
use it only for your own application files.

Adva makes it extensible: you can only pick those engines/features
you really need for your application and omit the rest. All engines are
designed to work together seamlessly, so the whole platform feels much more
consistent for similar but separate Rails applications.
