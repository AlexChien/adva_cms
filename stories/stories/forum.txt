Story: Posting to a forum
  As a user
  I want to post to a forum
  So I can participate in the discussion
  
  Scenario: An anonymous user creates a new topic in a forum without boards
    Given a forum that allows anonymous users to post comments
    Given the forum has no boards
    When the user goes to the forum page
    Then the page shows an empty list of topics
    When the user clicks on 'Post one now'
    Then the page has a topic creation form
    When the user fills in the topic creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks on the 'Post Topic' button
    Then the new topic is created
    And the initial topic comment is created
    And the user is redirected to the topic show page
    And the page shows 'the topic title'
    And the page shows 'the initial comment body'
