Story: Anonymous login
  As an anonymous user
  I can post my name, email and homepage
  So the system remembers me as an anonymous user
  
  Scenario: After submitting a comment as an anonymous the user is recognized by the system
    Given no anonymous accounts exist
    When the user submits a comment as an anonymous
    Then an anonymous account exists
    When the user visits the comments show page
    Then the system authenticates the user as a known anonymous
