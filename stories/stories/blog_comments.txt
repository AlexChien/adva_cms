Story: Commenting on a blog article
  As a user with a given role that allows me to comment in a blog
  I want to comment on an article
  So I can share my opinions
  
  # Scenario: An anonymous user comments on an article
  #   Given a blog that allows anonymous users to create comments
  #   And a published blog article with no comments
  #   When the user goes to the url /2008/1/1/the-article-title
  #   Then the page has a comment creation form
  #   And the form contains anonymous name and email fields
  #   When the user fills in the form with his name, email and comment
  #   And the user clicks the 'Submit comment' button
  #   Then the article has an unapproved comment
  #   And the user is redirected to the comment show page
