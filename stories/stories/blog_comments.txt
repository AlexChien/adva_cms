Story: Commenting on an article
  As a user with a given role that allows me to comment in a blog
  I want to comment on an article
  So I can share my opinions
  
  Scenario: An anonymous user comments on an article
    Given a blog that allows anonymous users to create comments
    And a published article
    And the article has no comments
    When the user GETs /2008/1/1/the-article-title
    Then the page has a comment creation form
    And the form contains anonymous name and email fields
    When the user fills in the form with his name, email and comment
    And the user clicks the 'Submit comment' button
    Then the article has an unapproved comment
    And the user is redirected to the comment show page
