Story: Previewing a blog article page
  As an admin
  I want to access an unpublished blog article's page
  So I can preview it

  Scenario: An blog article page for an unpublished article
    Given page cache is enabled and empty
    And an unpublished blog article
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user goes to the url /2008/1/1/the-article-title
    Then the page shows 'the article title'
    And the page is not cached
