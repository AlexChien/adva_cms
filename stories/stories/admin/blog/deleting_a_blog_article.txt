Story: Deleting a blog article
  As an admin
  I want to delete a blog article in the admin area
  So that the article is removed from the system

  Scenario: An admin deletes a blog article
    Given a blog with an article
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin blog article edit page
    And the user clicks on 'Delete this article'
    Then the user is redirected to the admin blog articles page
    And the article is deleted
