Story: Managing users
  As an admin
  I want to manage the users registered to a site
  
  Scenario: An admin creates a new user account
    Given a site
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin site user list page
    And the user clicks on 'Add user'
    Then the page has an admin user account creation form
    When the user fills in the admin user account creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    Then a new user account is created
    And the user is redirected to the admin site user show page

  Scenario: An admin updates a user's profile
    Given a site
    And the user is logged in as admin
    And another user
    And the other user is a member of the site
    When the user visits the admin site other user show page
    And the user clicks on 'Edit user'
    Then the page has an admin user account edit form
    When the user fills in name with 'an updated name'
