Story: Viewing an empty frontend after installation
  As a user
  I want to access the frontend after installation without doing anything else
  So I can leave the admin interface early
  
  Scenario:
    Given no site exists
    And no user exists
    When the user goes to the url /
    When the user fills in the site install form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    When the user clicks on 'logout'
    Then the user sees an empty homepage
