Story: Publishing a section article
  As an admin
  I want to write section articles in the admin area
  So they get published in the frontend
  
  Scenario: An admin writes a section article
    Given a section with no articles
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin section articles list page
    Then the page has an empty list
    When the user clicks on 'Create one now'
    Then the page has an admin article creation form
    And the 'Save as draft?' checkbox is checked by default
    When the user fills in the admin article creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Save article' button
    Then the user is redirected to the admin section articles edit page
    And a new article is saved

  Scenario: An admin previews a section article
    Given a section with an article
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin section article edit page
    And the user clicks on 'Preview'
    Then the page displays the article as preview

  Scenario: An admin publishes a blog article
    Given a section with an article
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin section article edit page
    And the user unchecks 'Yes, save this article as a draft'
    And the user clicks the 'Apply changes' button
    And the user goes to the section url on frontend
    Then the page displays the article
