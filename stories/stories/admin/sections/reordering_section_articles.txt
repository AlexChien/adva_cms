Story: Reordering section articles
  As an admin
  I want to reorder section articles
  So I can control which article is displayed as the primary article

  Scenario An admin reorders section articles do
    Given a section with two articles
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin section articles list page
    Then the page has a reorder articles link
    When the user moves the second article to the top
    Then the second article is sorted to the top
