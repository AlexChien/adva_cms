Story: Installing the initial site (and admin account)
  As a user
  I can install the initial site from a web form
  So I can get going quickly
  
  Scenario: A user installs the intial site
    Given no site exists
    And no user exists
    When the user goes to the url /
    Then the user sees the install page
    And the page has a site install form
    When the user fills in the site install form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    Then a new Site is created
    And the root section is saved
    And an admin account is created
    And the admin account is verified
    And the system authenticates the user as superuser
