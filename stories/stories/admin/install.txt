Story: Installing the initial site (and admin account)
  As a user
  I can install the initial site from a web form
  So I can get going quickly
  
  Scenario: A user installs the intial site
    Given no site
    And no user account
    When the user visits the domain root
    Then sees the install page
    And the page has a site install form
    When a user fills in the site install form with valid values
    And clicks the 'Create' button
    Then a new site is saved
    And a the root section is saved
    And an admin account is created
    And an admin account is verified
    And the user is authenticated as the admin
