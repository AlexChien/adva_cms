Story: Managing themes
  As an admin
  I want to manage my site's themes
  So I can change the site's look and feel
  
  Scenario An admin creates a new theme
    Given a site with no themes
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's theme list page
    Then the page has an empty list
    When the user clicks on 'New theme'
    Then the user sees the site's theme creation page
    And the page has a theme creation form
    When the user fills in the theme creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Save' button
    Then a new theme is saved
    And the user is redirected to the site's theme list page
  
  Scenario An admin updates a theme's settings
    Given a site with a theme
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's theme list page
    Then the page has a theme list with one entry
    When the user clicks on "edit"
    Then the user sees the theme show page
    And the page has a theme edit form
    When the user fills in Name with 'the updated name'
