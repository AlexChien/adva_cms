Story: Managing cached pages
  As an admin
  I want to manage my site's cached pages
  So I can manually control the cache
  
  Scenario: An admin views the empty cached pages list
    Given a blog
    And no pages are cached
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's cache index page
    Then the page has an empty list

  Scenario: An admin views cached pages list
    Given a site
    And a page is cached
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's cache index page
    Then the page has list of cached pages with one entry

  Scenario: An admin expires a cached page manually
    Given a blog
    And a page is cached
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's cache index page
    And the user clicks on 'Clear'
    Then the cached page's record and file are deleted

  Scenario: An admin expires all cached pages manually
    Given a blog
    And a page is cached
    And another page is cached
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the site's cache index page
    And the user clicks on 'Clear all'
    Then the cached page's record and file are deleted
    And the other cached page's record and file are deleted
