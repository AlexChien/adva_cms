Story: Managing assets
  As an admin
  I want to manage my site's assets
  So I can get use them on the site

  Scenario: An admin views the assets list
    Given a site with no assets
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits admin sites assets list page
    Then the page has an empty list
  
  Scenario: An admin uploads an asset
    Given a site with no assets
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits admin sites assets list page
    And the user clicks on 'New asset'
    Then the page has an admin asset creation form
    When the user fills in the admin asset creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Upload' button
    Then a new asset is saved
    And the user is redirected to admin sites assets list page
    Then the page has a list of assets with at least one asset
