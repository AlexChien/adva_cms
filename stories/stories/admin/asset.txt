Story: Managing assets
  As an admin
  I want to manage my site's assets
  So I can get use them on the site
  
  Scenario: An admin views the assets list
    Given a blog with no assets
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user GETs /admin/site/1/assets
    Then the page has an empty list of assets
  
  Scenario: An admin uploads an asset
    Given a blog with no assets
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user GETs /admin/site/1/assets/new
    Then the page has form posting to /admin/site/1/assets
    When the user POSTs to, '/admin/site/1/assets', assets=>[{uploaded_data => 'file', title => title, tag_list => foo bar}]
    Then a new asset is saved
    And the user is redirected to /admin/sites/1/assets
    When the user follows the redirect
    Then the page has a list of assets with one asset
