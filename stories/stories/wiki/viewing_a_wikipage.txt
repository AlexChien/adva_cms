Story: Viewing a wikipage
  As a visitor 
  I want to access a wiki's pages
  So I can read all the useful information
  
  Scenario: Viewing a wikipage revision
    Given page cache is enabled and empty
    And a wikipage that has a revision
    When the user visits the wikipage revision page
    Then the page shows 'the old wikipage body'
    And the page has a link for rolling back the wikipage
    And the page is cached
