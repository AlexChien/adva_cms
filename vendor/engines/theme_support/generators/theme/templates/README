Generating a new theme is only half the work, to use your theme you need to
copy it into your site's subdirectory or create a sym-link:
  cd themes/site-1"
  ln -s ../theme_name .  ## symlink OR
  cp -R ../theme_name . 

# Overriding Views

You can override views by putting custom `rhtml` or `liquid`
templates in this directory. You use the same folder structure
as Rails:

  views/
    [controller_name]/
      _overriden_partial.rhtml
      overriden_action.rhtml

*Note:* These are overrides! They will only work if they have
a matching view in the main rails `app/views` folder.
