TODO I18n strings
  adva_cms
    _user_activity.html.erb
    showed up <%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(user.updated_at) %> ago
    Josh: <%=t :'adva.common.latest_activity', :time_ago => distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(user.updated_at) %>

    theme_files/_files.html.erb
    type.titleize
    Josh: Ideally, titleize would be localized, maybe should be part of Globalize2. 
    How bad does this look in German? We should check other languages.
    
    helpers/base_helper.rb
    #pluralize_str
    Josh: I've been replacing these with i18n translations and using i18n's pluralization. No need for this method anymore.
    
    models/section.rb
    validates_numericality_of :articles_per_page, :only_integer => true, :message => "can only be whole number."
    Josh: :message => :only_integer; add to locale file: messages.only_integer

    lib/roles.rb
    :message => 'You need to be logged in to perform this action.'
    Josh: should probably be like AR validations: :message => :login_required; in yaml: adva.role.login_required
  
  adva_comments/comments_controller
    flash[:error] = @comment.errors.full_messages.to_sentence
    Josh: to_sentence is supported by i18n -- this should be fine
    
  adva_comments/comments_helper (in admin)
    comment_expiration_options
    Josh: Not sure what the issue is. I'd namespace it under something like adva.comment.expiration.not_allowed
    
  adva_forum
    forum.rb
      validates_numericality_of :topics_per_page, :only_integer => true, :message => "can only be whole number."
    Josh: see above, models/section.rb
    
* add roles interface
* remove observers and make behaviour more explicit by using events/listeners?
  e.g. page caching
* redesign/abstract adva_activity
* redesign rbac to work with arbitrary group memberships
