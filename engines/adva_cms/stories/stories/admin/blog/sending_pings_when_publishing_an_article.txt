# Story: Sending pings when publishing an article
#   As an admin
#   I want the blog to send pings to ping services when I publish an article
#   So my article gets more traffic
#   
#   Scenario: Publishing a new article triggers pings
#     Given a blog with no articles
#     And the user is logged in as admin
#     When the user creates and publishes a new article
#     Then the blog has sent pings
#   
#   Scenario: Publishing an existing article triggers pings
#     Given a blog with an article
#     When the user is logged in as admin
#     When the user updates and publishes the article
#     Then the blog has sent pings
#   
#   Scenario: Updating a published article does not trigger pings
#     Given a blog with a published article
#     When the user is logged in as admin
#     When the user updates the article
#     Then the blog has not sent any pings
#   
#   Scenario: Updating an unpublished article does not trigger pings
#     Given a blog with an unpublished article
#     When the user is logged in as admin
#     When the user updates the article
#     Then the blog has not sent any pings
#   
#   Scenario: Unpublishing an article does not trigger pings
#     Given a blog with a published article
#     When the user is logged in as admin
#     When the user unpublishes the article
#     Then the blog has not sent any pings
