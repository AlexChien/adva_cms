Story: Deleting a section article
  As an admin
  I want to delete a section article in the admin area
  So that the article is removed from the system

  Scenario: An admin deletes a section article
    Given the user is logged in as admin
    And a section with an article
    When the user visits the admin section articles list page
    Then the page has a list of articles
    When the user clicks on the article link
    Then the page has an admin article editing form
    When the user clicks on 'Delete this article'
    Then the user is redirected to the admin section articles page
    And the article is deleted
