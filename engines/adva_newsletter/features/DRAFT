In the first part: Basic stuff working
======================================

* create newsletters
* create subscription
* create issue aka sending letters out to the messaging queue 
    We probably need some general messaging queue, I made some research and suggest to pick one from those:
      * ap4r
      * BackgroundRB
      
controllers:
  newsletters
  issues

models:
  Site (adva_cms model)
    has_many :newsletters

  Newsletter
    belongs_to :site
    has_many :subscriptions, :as => :subscribable
    has_many :users, :through => :subscriptions
    has_many :issues
    has_many :assets, :as => :assetable #TODO: fix current assets to become assetable, talk with others about it
    
  Subscription (new adva_cms model)
    belongs_to :subscribable, :polymorphic => true, :counter_cache => true
    belongs_to :newsletter, :class_name => 'Newsletter', :foreign_key => 'subscribable_id'  

  Issue
    belongs_to :newsletter
    
  Mailer < ActionMailer::Base 
    propably this functionality goes out from newsletter itself, perhaps to engines/messenger or to plugin-gem
    
In the second part
==================

* persanalized emails (perhaps with some template system or smth, I have to think a bit about it)
* pictures and attachments
