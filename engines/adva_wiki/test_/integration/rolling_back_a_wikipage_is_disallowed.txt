Story: Rolling back a wikipage is disallowed
  As a user with a given role that does not allow me to update wikipages
  I can not rollback a wikipage to a previous revision
  So I can not change the wiki content
  
  Scenario: An anonymous user can not rollback a wikipage
    Given a wiki that allows registered users to create and update wikipages
    And a wikipage that has a revision
    When the user visits the wikipage revision page
    And the user clicks on 'rollback to this revision'
    Then the user sees the login page
